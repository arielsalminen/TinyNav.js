# TinyNav.js
### Responsive navigation plugin that weighs just 452 bytes

[TinyNav.js](http://tinynav.viljamis.com/) is a tiny jQuery plugin (452 bytes minified and gzipped) that converts `<ul>` and `<ol>` navigations to a select boxes for small screen. It also automatically selects the current page and adds `selected="selected"` for that item. There's also a Wordpress plugin available, [here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tinynav/).

This isn't the first plugin to do this and it doesn't provides a lot of options, but it might be the smallest (file size).

Check out also the new version called [Responsive Nav](http://responsive-nav.com).

v1.04 (2012-10-19) - Adds the possibility to change the text of the header.

v1.03 (2012-03-15) - Adds new option called "header", thanks to [@jorde](https://github.com/jorde)

v1.02 (2012-03-07) - Some performance improvements and a bug fix
